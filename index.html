			Hi there! I'm Nicole Cybul. Currently, I'm a senior studying Course 6-3 (Computer Science) at MIT.
			I'll be graduating in the Spring of 2023, and then I will be moving to <span translate="no">NYC</span> to pursue a
			career in software engineering. Some of my interests include learning about astronomy
			and physics. I love to read books about the beginning of our universe, and I have recently 
			started learning more about particle physics in my free time. I also enjoy taking long 
			walks along the esplanade here in <span translate="no">Cambridge / Boston</span> and listening to music.
			Fun fact: according to my <span translate="no">Spotify Wrapped</span>, I listened to 143,149 minutes of music 
			last year which equates to 6+ hours each day on average!
